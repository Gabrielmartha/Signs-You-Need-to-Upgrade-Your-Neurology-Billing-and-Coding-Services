# README: Signs You Need to Upgrade Your Neurology Billing and Coding Services

## Overview

As neurology practices evolve, so do the complexities of medical billing and coding.

## 1. Frequent Coding Errors and Claim Denials

Neurology billing involves intricate codes. Errors or outdated documentation can disrupt revenue flow.

**Solution:** Partner with neurology billing specialists to ensure accurate, compliant submissions from the start.

## 2. Delayed or Inconsistent Reimbursements

Late or unpredictable payments often result from inefficient billing systems or non-compliance.

**Solution:** Upgrade to a streamlined RCM solution to accelerate turnaround times and improve cash flow.

## 3. Lack of Transparency in Financial Reporting

Without clear financial insights, it's hard to plan ahead or spot issues in real time.

**Solution:** Use reporting tools and dashboards (like those from iMagnum) for detailed, actionable analytics.

## 4. Difficulty Keeping Up with Regulatory Changes

Annual updates to CPT, ICD-10, and payer rules demand constant vigilance.

**Solution:** Work with a provider that ensures full compliance and ongoing education to avoid denials.
